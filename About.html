            <p>I've always been interested in computers, and I've always been able to use them well enough to be the guy who fixes them for friends and family, most of the time.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I've spent my life roming outside in the woods or wasting time on the internet. I've built houses and made old woodwork look new again. I was briefly a craftsman with a high end design company here in Boston, but I didn't see a future doing that.</p>

            <p>I chased a dream and learned PHP with some friends of mine who build their own webistes and applications. It was idyllic, and I loved our office space. I couldn't dedicate the time needed to excel, however, and I grew frustrated at my own pace. I still needed to pay bills, after all, and I couldn't justify not working at all while I developed a new skill.</p>

            <p>While I have a long way to go, I feel confident that my ability to build on the foundation I've already laid is strong. I have a varied skill set to draw upon, and I have a lot of experiences to influence my work, and hopefully, make my final products unique and well rounded.</p>
